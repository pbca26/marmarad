# Marmara v.1.0.1 Usage Guide

## Linux
## Getting Started

If you have downloaded and build MCL from source then you can run the commands under ```cd komodo/src``` directory. According to your configuration, ```komodod``` and ```komodo-cli```  may be under different directories. Hence, find where they are and change directory accordingly.

Launch the Marmara Chain with the following parameters:
```
./komodod -ac_name=MCL -ac_supply=2000000 -ac_cc=2 -addnode=37.148.210.158 -addnode=37.148.212.36 -addressindex=1 -spentindex=1 -ac_marmara=1 -ac_staked=75 -ac_reward=3000000000 &
```
Wait until it connects and synchronizes. You may check if the node sychronized to the chain by executing the following: 
```
./komodo-cli -ac_name=MCL getinfo
```

**_Indexing (Optional step for fastening up the process of downloading all the blocks)_**

Newcomers need to wait for all the blocks to be downloaded to their machine. To fasten up this process, [bootstrap](https://eu.bootstrap.dexstats.info/MCL-bootstrap.tar.gz) may be downloaded and used. 

Stop the Marmara blockchain by executing the following command:
```	
./komodo-cli -ac_name=MCL stop
```

To install bootstrap from the command line, execute the following command:
```
wget https://eu.bootstrap.dexstats.info/MCL-bootstrap.tar.gz
```
Now, in the following command, tar will extract the bootstrap contents in a specific directory as shown below:
```
tar -xvf MCL-bootstrap.tar.gz -C .komodo/MCL
```
Now, relaunch the Marmara Chain by using the following command:
```
./komodod -ac_name=MCL -ac_supply=2000000 -ac_cc=2 -addnode=37.148.210.158 -addnode=37.148.212.36 -addnode=46.4.238.65 -addressindex=1 -spentindex=1 -ac_marmara=1 -ac_staked=75 -ac_reward=3000000000 &
```

## Creating A Pubkey and Launching MCL with pubkey

To use Marmara Credit Loops, a user must have a **pubkey** and launch the chain with a **pubkey**. Otherwise, any mining or staking in the smart chain would be in vain. Since all mined or staked coins will also be sent to this address. 

In order to get a pubkey, launch the Marmara Chain with the normal launch parameters and execute the [getnewaddress](https://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/smart-chains/smart-chain-api/wallet.html#getnewaddress) API command.
```	
./komodo-cli -ac_name=MCL getnewaddress
```
This will in turn return a new address:
```	
DO_NOT_USE_THIS_ADDRESSgg5jonaes1J5L786
```
Now, execute the [validateaddress](https://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/smart-chains/smart-chain-api/util.html#validateaddress) command.
```	
./komodo-cli -ac_name=MCL validateaddress DO_NOT_USE_THIS_ADDRESSgg5jonaes1J5L786
```
This will return a json object with many properties. In the properties one can see:
```	
"pubkey": "DO_NOT_USE_THIS_ADDRESS019n79b0921a1be6d3ca6f9e8a050mar17eb845fe46b9d756"
```

This will be your MCL pubkey, make sure to note it. You must now indicate it to the daemon.

In order do this, first stop the daemon.
```	
./komodo-cli -ac_name=MCL stop
```
Then relaunch your daemon using the required parameters, and make sure to include your pubkey as an additional parameter. For example:
```	
./komodod -ac_name=MCL -ac_supply=2000000 -ac_cc=2 -addnode=37.148.210.158 -addnode=37.148.212.36 -addnode=46.4.238.65 -addressindex=1 -spentindex=1 -ac_marmara=1 -ac_staked=75 -ac_reward=3000000000 -gen -genproclimit=1 -pubkey=DO_NOT_USE_THIS_ADDRESS019n79b0921a1be6d3ca6f9e8a050mar17eb845fe46b9d756 &
```
>```-genproclimit``` sets the number of threads to be used for mining. 

>In the command above, if the parameter ```-genproclimit``` is set to 1 such as ```-gen -genproclimit=1``` launches the Marmara Chain with single (1) CPU. Note that you can set this to any number of cores such as 3. 

>In the command above, if the parameter ```-genproclimit``` is set to -1 such as ```-gen -genproclimit=-1``` launches the Marmara Chain with the whole CPU.

>In the command above, if the parameter ```-genproclimit``` is set to 0 such as ```-gen -genproclimit=0``` launches the Marmara Chain with Staking mode on and stakes on the Activated coin.  

## dumpprivkey

The `dumpprivkey` method reveals the private key corresponding to the indicated address.
The command for this is given below for demo purposes.
```
./komodo-cli -ac_name=MCL dumpprivkey "PWqwYaWNEVT7V9SdfFHARWnoB7vcpSfdvs"
```
The response of the command gives the private address as in the example below:
```
DONOTUSETHISxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx7KkCmRnnSg7iXvRUqhYoxC9Y
```

## importprivkey

The `importprivkey` method adds a private key (as returned by dumpprivkey) to your wallet. The command may take several arguments as described in [here](https://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/smart-chains/smart-chain-api/wallet.html#importprivkey).
The simplest form of command for this is given below for demo purposes.
```
./komodo-cli -ac_name=MCL importprivkey "DONOTUSETHISxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx7KkCmRnnSg7iXvRUqhYoxC9Y"
```
The response of the command gives the wallet address as in the demo response below:
```
R9z796AehK5b6NCPeVkGUHSpJnawerf8oP
```
Now, the wallet address can be validated through ```validateaddress``` to get the MCL pubkey:
```
./komodo-cli -ac_name=MCL validateaddress R9z796AehK5b6NCPeVkGUHSpJnawerf8oP
``` 
After getting the respective MCL pubkey from the response of the command above, relaunch the Marmara Chain with that pubkey.  

## Creating a Wallet Address from One's own Words in Marmara Blockchain

As previously explained, one can make use of the command `./komodo-cli -ac_name=MCL getnewaddress` in order to get a wallet address and then use the command `./komodo-cli -ac_name=MCL validateaddress "Rwalletno"` to get the respective Privkey.

However, the `Privkey` received in this way consists of a hard to remember combination of letters and number. Note that keeping this privkey safe and secure and reachable only by you is very important and essential way to reach your assets. Hence, one can generate a privkey from his/her own set of words and keep a record of these words to generate the respective privkey whenerever needed.

For this purpose, create a set of keywords that have **no special characters** in them. For instance: `"You can create your own keywords and generate a privkey from these whenever needed"`.

Then use the following command to get the respective privkey generated:
```
./komodo-cli -ac_name=MCL convertpassphrase "You can create your own keywords and generate a privkey from these whenever needed"
``` 
The command in turn returns the following JSON Object:
```
{ 
    "agamapassphrase": "You can create your own keywords and generate a privkey from these whenever needed",
    "address": "RB8v8b9yt9U6YSuznLieSU8ULCnT77YM8f",
    "pubkey": "02b8aa5cb5ff919b773656b0701f8448bb226b62e966c8439dd90183c8c3efdc24", 
    "privkey": "d83991e517c0d73846171c105dely8e77e548c1faa21ed8efbb9b6ffe4595446a", 
    "wif": "UwFidzXW7iaKozsyb2JWmPTV2JZAapkXFyDWtMEB8a6fv1nnoFmk"
}
```
Later, one can use `importprivkey` method to add the respective private key to the wallet address:

```
./komodo-cli -ac_name=MCL importprivkey "UwFidzXW7iaKozsyb2JWmPTV2JZAapkXFyDWtMEB8a6fv1nnoFmk"
```
Now, the owner of the assets needs to keep a record of the keyword combination safely to generate the respective privkey whenever needed.
**Remember that private keys should always be kept secret and so are the keywords!** 

## Checking the staking/mining mode of your node in Marmara Chain

The following command helps to check the mode of the node:
```	 
./komodo-cli -ac_name=MCL getgenerate
```
Once the command given above is executed, the following JSON object gets returned:
```	
{
  "staking": false,
  "generate": true,
  "numthreads": 1
}
```
From above, it can be seen that the node is in the **mining** node.
>```"staking": false``` means that staking is off.
> ```"generate": false``` means that mining is active.
>```"numthreads": 1``` refers to the number of cores used for mining. In this case, this parameter was set to one earlier.
>
To change mode of the node to **staking**, execute the command below:
```	   
 ./komodo-cli -ac_name=MCL setgenerate true 0
```
Now checking the status of the node:
```
 ./komodo-cli -ac_name=MCL getgenerate
```
This returns a JSON object:
```
{
  "staking": true,
  "generate": false,
  "numthreads": 0
}
```
> Note that ```"staking": true``` _**will not be of use**_ if you have no activated coins!

## Sending Coins to an Address
One may directly send a payment to a given address by issuing the following command. The payment is made based on the **Normal Amount** available on the respective wallet.
The amount is rounded to the nearest 0.00000001. A transaction fee is deducted for the transaction being made from one's Normal Amount.
```
./komodo-cli -ac_name=MCL sendtoaddress "MCL_address" amount
```
> **Note:** This command directly sends payment to the specified address and should be used carefully. As, the payment sent through this method cannot be redeemed later. 


## Reaching Details about Node and Wallet in Marmara Chain
The following commands are useful for getting details about your node and wallet.
- ```getinfo``` 
```
./komodo-cli -ac_name=MCL getinfo
```

```getinfo``` command returns important details such as the version of MARMARA through ```"version"```; synchronization status of your node through ```synced``` (this parameter's value is true if the parameters "blocks" and "longestchain" are equal ); difficulty of the chain through ```"difficulty"```; number of nearest connected nodes to the chain through ```"connections"```; the pubkey with which you are connected to the chain through ```"pubkey":```

- ```getpeerinfo``` 
```
./komodo-cli -ac_name=MCL getpeerinfo  
```
This command returns detailed information on nearest connected nodes to the chain around your node.
- ```marmarainfo```  
```
./komodo-cli -ac_name=MCL marmarainfo 0 0 0 0 pubkey
```
```marmarainfo``` command returns important details such as the normal amount in the pubkey through ```"myPubkeyNormalAmount"```; the activated amount through  ```"myActivatedAmount"```; the details of credit loops made through ```"Loops"```; the total amount locked in credit loops through ```"TotalLockedInLoop"```; the number of credit loops closed through ```"numclosed"```; and the details of credit loops closed through ```"closed"```.

##Activating and Deactivating Coins

- ```marmaralock``` is used to activate the coins. Active coins are needed for staking and if there are none then even if the staking mode is on, no blocks would be found through staking. The entire command is given below and the **amount** is to be replaced by the amount of coins such as 1000.  
```  
./komodo-cli -ac_name=MCL marmaralock amount
```
This command in turn returns a JSON object with the result of the operation and the hex created for it. Note that the _**"hex"**_ given below is for demonstration purposes.
```
{
  "result": "success",
  "hex": "0400008085202f89020039b219200ae4b5c83d77bffce7a8af054d6fb..........e9181f6aac3e1beb1e260e9a1f49ed24e6ac00000000edeb04000000000000000000000000"
}
```
Now, in order to confirm this transaction, copy the hex returned through the JSON object and validate it through the ```sendrawtrasaction``` command given below.
```  
./komodo-cli -ac_name=MCL sendrawtranscation 0400008085202f89020039b219200ae4b5c83d77bffce7a8af054d6fb..........e9181f6aac3e1beb1e260e9a1f49ed24e6ac00000000edeb04000000000000000000000000
```
If the avove command gets successfully executed in the blockchain, it gives out a transaction id in response. One may check if this transaction is verified by searching the respective id in the [Marmara Explorer site](http://explorer.marmara.io).
To see the activated coins, use ```marmarainfo``` command provided earlier and search for the value across the ```"myActivatedAmount"``` parameter. Note that the raw transactions are collected in the mempool and a few blocks may be needed to found to see the transaction recorded on the block.


- ```marmaraunlock``` is used deactivate the coins i.e. turn them into normal amount. Normal Amount is utilized for sending payments directly to an address through```sendtoaddress``` command explained earlier. The **amount** is to be replaced by the amount of coins to be deactivated such as 500.   
```  
./komodo-cli -ac_name=MCL marmaraunlock amount
```
In the same way explained earlier, this transaction needs to be validated through the ```sendrawtrasaction``` command given above. For this purpose, copy the hex returned by ```marmaraunlock``` command and use it with ```sendrawtrasaction``` command.
  
- ```listaddressgroupings``` is used to list the pairs of wallet addresses and respective normal amounts in them. The usage is given in the command below.
```
./komodo-cli -ac_name=MCL listaddressgroupings
```

## How to Make Marmara Credit Loops
The current Marmara Credit loops currently work based on Protocol 1 which is in 100% collateralization mode. 100 % collateralization is made by issuer on behalf of both himself/herself and holder. Both issuer and holder have the 3x staking chance to get blockchain rewards. Issuer has the 3x staking chance until maturity date of credit whereas holder has the 3x staking chance until he/she endorses/transfers the credit to a new holder who will continue staking with the issuer. 
The Credit loops can be made using only activated coins.
### Terminology
**Issuer:** The person who first creates a credit in a credit loop. It is the person who forms the first node in the credit loop. The credit may be collateralized 100% or with even zero-collateralization until maturity date of a credit.

**Bearer (Holder):** The last node in a credit loop is always called bearer (holder). When someone transfers a credit in a loop, that node becomes immediately an endorser.

**Endorser:** All other nodes that fall between the issuer, which is the first node in the credit loop, and the last node, and transfer the credit to the next node.

**Maturity:** The time a credit expires. It is measured as blocks in estimation. The block per day is 1440 (60 blocks an hour times 24 hours a day). Suppose a credit is for 100 days, the maturity is 1440x100, i.e. 144,000 blocks.

**Settlement:** When a credit matures, settlement is made to the holder, the last node in a loop. Settlement may be automatic or manual.

**Escrow:** Trust based parties for Protocol 2. If EscrowOn is false, then 100% collateralization is used and settlement is automatic. There is no need for escrows in protocol 1 which works as complete trustless version.

**Avalist:** Avalists support issuer or endorsers with MCL as additional colletarization and can earn with 3x staking with those support. In case of non-redemption, their funds are utilized. Avalists are available only in Protocol 2. The parameter avalcount is always zero for protocol 1.

**BlockageAmount:** This is a term for protocol 2. An issuer may be asked to put some collateralization by a holder. In that case, the issuer gets benefit of 3x staking in protocol 2.

**Dispute Expiry:** It is grace period for solving non-redemption problem in credit loops in protocol 2. An issuer may have this time as blocks when creating a credit under protocol 2 without or insufficient collateralization. Before this period expires, an escrow should do all actions according to aggrement with the issuer to solve non-redemption. Otherwise, the escrow is penalized in the system.

###Important Commands for Making Credit Loops
- ```marmararecieve```

This command is used to get a credit from an issuer or an endorser. When asking a credit from an issuer, i.e. the first node, it has a unique use. In other nodes, it is the same.

**Scenario 1:** Two nodes are making a credit loop for the first time. This credit loop may be created for a sale of a good or service in the market. In such case, the holder (the one selling the product/service) should request for a credit from the issuer (the one paying the product/service) by writing down the following command:
```
./komodo-cli -ac_name=MCL marmarareceive senderpk amount currency matures '{"avalcount":"n"}'
```
>```senderpk``` is the pubkey address of the issuer (the one paying the product/service)
>
>```amount``` is the payment amount. Please note that this amount should be available in activated fund of the issuer and if not then must be activated thru ```marmaralock``` command by th issuer.
>
>```currency``` is MARMARA
>
>```matures``` is the time that respective credit expires, 60 blocks an hour times 24 hours a day making 1440 blocks per day.
>
>```'{"avalcount":"n"}'``` is the number of avalists i.e. '{"avalcount":"0"}' for protocol 1. 


This marmarareceive call generates a hex code. This HEXCODE needs to be verified by the holder by executing the ```sendrawtransaction``` command:
```
./komodo-cli -ac_name=MCL sendrawtransaction HEXCODE

```
Once this command is executed, a transaction id named ```txid``` gets generated. This ```txid``` along with the ```receiverpk``` needs to be communicated to the issuer to complete the credit loop. But, an alternative to this communication would be the use of ```marmarareceivelist``` method which could be used to see the receive requests made to the issuer himself/herself.

```marmarareceivelist``` method would be executed by the issuer by the following command:
```
./komodo-cli -ac_name=MCL marmarareceivelist pubkey

```
> ```pubkey``` is the pubkey address of the issuer connected to the Marmara Chain
>The response of this command is a list of pair of txid's created by the respective pubkeys.

- ```marmaraissue```

This command is only used by issuer, the first node to create/issue a credit. By this, a credit is also transferred to the first holder, i.e. the second node. Many of the parameters for a credit loop is decided between the issuer and the first holder.
```marmaraissue``` method takes in the following arguments: 
```
./komodo-cli -ac_name=MCL marmaraissue receiverpk '{"avalcount":"n", "autosettlement":"true"|"false", "autoinsurance":"true"|"false", "disputeexpires":"offset", "EscrowOn":"true"|"false", "BlockageAmount":"amount" }' requesttxid
```
>```receiverpk``` is the pubkey of the receiver which is the holder.
>
>```"avalcount":"n"``` is the number of avalists i.e. '{"avalcount":"0"}' for protocol 1. 
>
>``` "autosettlement":"true"|"false"``` AutoSettlement is true due to 100% collateralization in Protocol 1.
>
>```"autoinsurance":"true"|"false"``` Autoinsurance is true due to 100% collateralization in Protocol 1.
>
>```"disputeexpires":"offset"```  Dispute expiry is set to 0 due to 100 collateralization in Protocol 1.
>
>```"EscrowOn":"true"|"false"``` EscrowOn is set to false due to 100% collateralization in Protocol 1.
>
>```"BlockageAmount":"amount" }``` blockage amount is set to 0 due to 100 collateralization in Protocol 1.
>
>```requesttxid``` is the txid generated by the holder communicated to the issuer. 

A typical example of a ```marmaraissue``` command to complete the credit loop by the issuer is given below:
```
./komodo-cli -ac_name=MCL marmaraissue receiverpk '{"avalcount":"0", "autosettlement":"true", "autoinsurance":"true", "disputeexpires":"0", "EscrowOn":"false", "BlockageAmount":"0" }' requesttxid
```
This ```marmaraissue``` command in turn returns a hex code response, and now the issuer has to execute the sendrawtransaction method to get the transaction executed on the blockchain as follows:
```
./komodo-cli -ac_name=MCL sendrawtransaction HEXCODE

```
This creates a credit loop between the issuer and the holder. The credits locked in a loop can be circulated to buy things during shopping. The issuer and the holder get 3 times of chances of staking on the MCL funds until the maturity of the credit loop.
- ```marmaracreditloop```

To display the credit loop between the issuer and the holder, the following ```marmaracreditloop``` command may be executed:
```
./komodo-cli -ac_name=MCL marmaracreditloop txid
```
> ```txid``` is the baton transfer id of the Marmara Credit Loop.

- ```marmaratransfer```

**Scenario 2:** The holder from the previous scenario wishes to utilize the coins locked in loop by buying goods/services on the same credit loop created earlier. For such case, when the holder transfers a credit in a loop, that node immediately becomes an endorser. And in such way, the last node in a credit loop is always called the bearer (holder). In other words, all endorsers are previously holders.
One should bear in mind that endorsers lose the 3x staking power when a credit is transferred to a new holder.

For this purpose, the new holder makes a ```marmarareceive``` request to the endorser to get the credit for selling the goods/services by the following command:
```
./komodo-cli -ac_name=MCL marmarareceive senderpk batontxid '{"avalcount":"n"}'
```
>```senderpk``` is the pubkey address of the endorser (the one buying the product/service)
>```batontxid``` is the baton transaction id of the previously created credit loop
>```'{"avalcount":"n"}'``` is the number of avalists i.e. '{"avalcount":"0"}' for protocol 1.

This marmarareceive call generates a hex code. This HEXCODE needs to be verified by the new holder by executing the ```sendrawtransaction``` command:
```
./komodo-cli -ac_name=MCL sendrawtransaction HEXCODE

```
Once this command is executed, a transaction id named ```txid``` gets generated. This ```txid``` along with the ```receiverpk``` needs to be communicated to the endorser to complete the credit loop. But, an alternative to this communication would be the use of ```marmarareceivelist``` method which could be used by the endorser to see the receive requests made to himself/herself.
Then, the endorser executes the following ```marmaratransfer```command to get the credits transferred to the new holder:
```
./komodo-cli -ac_name=MCL marmaratransfer receiverpk '{"avalcount":"n"}' requesttxid
```
>```receiverpk``` is the pubkey of the receiver which is the new holder.
>
>```"avalcount":"n"``` is the number of avalists i.e. '{"avalcount":"0"}' for protocol 1. 
>
>```requesttxid``` is the txid generated by the new holder communicated to the endorser. 

Then the endorser executes the ```sendrawtransaction``` command with the hex code resulting from ```marmaratransfer```command.

>Please Note that ```sendrawtransaction``` command is used after ```marmarareceive```, ```marmaraissue```, ```marmaratransfer``` and ```marmaralock``` to make the results of commands to be executed on blockchain. The usage is presented throughout the scenario 1 and 2.

**In this way, the credit loops can circulate up to 1000th node _within_ the maturity time to buy goods/services.**


## Taking Backup of Wallet

Backing up the `wallet.dat` file is very essential as it holds the assets of one.
On a Linux machine, the file could be found in: `~/.komodo/MCL/wallet.dat`

One method to backup this file is to archive a copy of the file.

```bash
#Copy the wallet.dat file
cp -av ~/.komodo/MCL/wallet.dat ~/wallet.dat

#Rename the wallet.dat file
mv ~/wallet.dat ~/2020-08-09-wallet_backup.dat

# Make an archieve of the wallet.dat file
tar -czvf ~/2020-08-09-wallet_backup.dat.tgz ~/2020-08-09-wallet_backup.dat

# Move the final file to a secure location
```
